Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. 

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- No, the slope is not zero because the p-value is less than 0.05.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

- Since the r^2 value is 71.5%, that means that the model will predict mpg values correctly about 71.5% of the time. This would be mildly effective.
